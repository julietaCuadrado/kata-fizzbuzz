FizzBuzz kata in the TDD way

I'm trying to have the TDD habit while developing.
Therefore, I'm developing some katas with TDD style in order to learn and interiorize it has my daily routine.

This one is FizzBuzz, it is simple, and then some one needs to modify it and you have a set of requirements wich makes you change the code in each iteration

FizzBuzz MVP
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.
